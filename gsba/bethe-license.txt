This program is released under a "I hope no one has to deal with this

distributing it in source- or binary form, as long as you do not blame
me if anything goes wrong.

If you find the program useful, I would appreciate a citation to

   Knizia, Chan - Density Matrix Embedding: A Simple Alternative
      to Dynamical Mean-Field Theory
   http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.186404

in published work using the program. That is the paper for which it
was written. In any case you should cite

   Shiba - Magnetic Susceptibility at Zero Temperature for the
      One-Dimensional Hubbard Model
   http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.6.930

which describes the algorithm which was employed in this program.
